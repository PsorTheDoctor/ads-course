 * Program reads a list of points in a plane
 * and outputs any group of four or more colinear points
 * (i.e. points on the same line).
 * The algorithm uses of sorting and have a time complexity of O(N^2 log N).
 * The ordering of the output is irrelevant.
 *
 * To show how it works please run a Main.java file.
